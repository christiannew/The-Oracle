# The Oracle: Open-Source Trademark Prediction Tool

## **Mission Statement**

**The Oracle** is an open-source AI-powered tool designed to predict future product names, check trademark availability, and empower individuals by leveling the playing field against corporate monopolization of intellectual property. This tool is built as a resource for creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators, ensuring fair access to name ownership.

## **Core Features (Planned)**

✅ **AI-Driven Naming Predictions** – Uses NLP & machine learning to predict likely future product names based on past trends from companies like Apple, Tesla, gaming studios, etc.

✅ **Trademark Availability Checker** – Cross-references predicted names with existing trademark databases (USPTO, WIPO, etc.).

✅ **Open-Source & Community-Driven** – Fully accessible for contributors, with no gatekeeping or restrictions.

✅ **Legal Filing Guide** – Provides simple step-by-step guidance for securing trademarks without requiring expensive lawyers.

✅ **Future Expansion** – Integration of global trademark databases, real-time monitoring of corporate trademark filings, and advanced AI-powered forecasting.

## **Project Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: GitHub Infrastructure & Repo Setup** (✅ Current Step)

- Establish repo structure
